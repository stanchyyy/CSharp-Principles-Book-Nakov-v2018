            //Task: 13 Make list with the most popular programming languages. How do they differ from C#.

            //Solution
            //Python - Python is dynamically typed.Python is a dynamically-interpreted language, whereas C# is a statically-typed compiled language.


            /*JavaScript - C# is compiled to a bytecode that is an intermediate form to be run by a JIT compiler. JavaScript was once only interpreted but is now often run through a JIT compiler.
            C# is statically typed, while JavaScript is dynamically typed.
            C# is strongly typed, while JavaScript isn’t.
            C# has LINQ, a powerful .NET component that adds native data querying capabilities, but JavaScript has separate libraries that can cover this functionality, one being Underscore.js.
            C# gives the programming explicit control over threading. JavaScript hides much of this with its call-and-response function structure.
            C# has operator and conversion overloading. JavaScript does not.

            /*Java - Java runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) whereas C# is designed to be run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
            Java is a class-based Object Oriented language whereas C# is Object-Oriented, functional, strong typing, component-oriented.
            Java doesn’t support for operator overloading whereas C# provides operator overloading for multiple operators.
            Java does not support pointers while C# supports pointer only in an unsafe mode.
            In Java, Arrays are a direct specialization of Object whereas arrays in C# are a specialization of System.
